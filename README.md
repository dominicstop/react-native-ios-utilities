hello, this is a helper library, and doesn‚Äôt really do anything on it‚Äôs own. This library is meant to be used as a dependency for some other libraries i am making ‚Äî i.e. as a way to share code, and prevent duplicated logic.

Please see the [version compatibility](#version-compatibility) table for reference.

## üöß‚ö†Ô∏è Re-Write WIP üöß‚ö†Ô∏è

This library is being re-written to support both the new + old architecture. Please see this is [issue](https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-context-menu/issues/100#issuecomment-2077986438) for progress üòî

**Overview**:

- [`RNIBaseView`](ios/Sources/RNIBaseView): A shared/common ‚Äúbase view‚Äù to allow for making native components that work on both fabric (the new architecture) and paper (please see: [`RNIWrapperView`](ios/Sources/RNIWrapperView) for an example implementation).
- [`RNIContentViewDelegate`](ios/Sources/RNIContentView/RNIContentViewDelegate.swift): A delegate that let‚Äôs the conforming `UIView` (written in swift) to manage + communicate with its associated parent fabric/paper view, and handle layout, receive props + async view commands from JS, and dispatch events from native.
- [`RNIViewLifecyleEvent`](ios/Sources/RNIViewLifecycle): a set of delegates for receiving common view lifecycle events between fabric + paper, as well as receiving events that are either fabric-only or paper-only. Please see [`RNIBaseViewEventBroadcaster`](ios/Sources/RNIBaseView/RNIBaseViewEventBroadcaster.swift) for an overview of what events are supported.
- [`RNIContentViewParentDelegate`](): Exposes useful properties and methods from the parent paper/fabric view (e.g. controlling size/layout, getting the layout metrics, etc).
- [`RNIBaseViewController`](ios/Sources/RNIBaseView/RNIBaseViewController.swift): A base implementation of a view controller that wraps a paper/fabric view and handles its sizing + layout when attached to non-react view.
- [`RNIUtilitiesModule`](src/native_modules/RNIUtilitiesModule/RNIUtilitiesModule.ts): A helper JSI module that allows for sharing sync data between swift and js, and sending async commands to either views that conform to `RNIContentViewDelegate`, or objects that conform to [`RNIModuleCommandRequestHandling¬†`](ios/Sources/RNIUtilitiesModule/RNIModuleCommandRequestHandling.swift) (please see the [js](src/native_components/RNIDummyTestView/RNIDummyTestViewModule.ts) + [swift](ios/Sources/RNIDummyTestView/RNIDummyTestViewModuleRequestHandler.swift) impl. of `RNIDummyTestViewModule` for a crude example).

- **Types and Parsing**: Contains [typescript definitions](src/types) for native types (e.g. `UIKit`, `CoreGraphics` primitives, etc) so they can be represented in JS, as well as the associated code to parse them in native (e.g. [`InitializableFromDictionary`](ios/Sources/Extensions+InitializableFromDictionary), [`InitializableFromString`](ios/Sources/Extensions+InitializableFromString), dictionary helpers, etc).
- **Misc**: Contains a bunch of helpers + extensions for working with RN across swift/objc/c++, and has a dependency to [`DGSwiftUtilities`](https://github.com/dominicstop/DGSwiftUtilities/tree/main/Sources) for more helpers + utilities written in swift.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-ios-utilities@next
cd ios && pod install
```

<br>

### Optional Extra Steps

In your project's `Podfile`, you can also explicitly set `REACT_NATIVE_TARGET_VERSION` env. to your specific RN version (see code snippet below). 

```ruby
require 'json'

reactNativeVersion = '0.0.0'
begin
  reactNativeVersion = `node --print "require('react-native/package.json').version"`
rescue
  reactNativeVersion = '0.0.0'
end

reactNativeTargetVersion = reactNativeVersion.split('.')[1].to_i
ENV['REACT_NATIVE_TARGET_VERSION'] = reactNativeTargetVersion.to_s
```

<br>

The `REACT_NATIVE_TARGET_VERSION` env. variable gets passed as a macro constant, and is used for conditional compilation (e.g. to fix code due to changes with the RN API).

Alternatively, you can just set `REACT_NATIVE_TARGET_VERSION` env. directly when you invoke `pod install` (e.g. `REACT_NATIVE_TARGET_VERSION=76 pod install`).

When you run `pod install`, you should see the following output in the terminal:

```
react-native-ios-utilities
 - reactNativeTargetVersion: 0.75.2
 - reactNativeTargetVersionOverride: 76
 - fabric_enabled: true
 - linkage: static
```
